# Migration Fix for Latest Research by Category Feature

## Background

During the development of the "Latest Research by Category" feature, we created multiple migration files that progressively evolved the feature:

1. `0002_lists_latest_research_categories.py` - Initially added a ManyToManyField to `Subject`
2. `0003_alter_latest_research_categories_verbose_name.py` - Updated verbose name
3. `0004_update_latest_research_help_text.py` - Updated help text
4. `0005_change_latest_research_to_teamcategory.py` - Changed the relation from `Subject` to `TeamCategory`

This progressive approach made it difficult to track the changes and caused potential issues when deploying to different environments.

## Solution

We consolidated these migrations into a single clean migration file that directly implements the final state of the feature:

1. Removed all the old migration files (0002-0005)
2. Created a new migration file `0002_add_latest_research_categories.py` that adds the latest_research_categories field as a ManyToManyField to TeamCategory with all the correct attributes
3. Used `--fake` flag to handle the database state since the tables already existed

## Implementation Details

The final implementation:

- Adds a ManyToManyField from Lists to TeamCategory
- Includes proper verbose name and help text
- Maintains all functionality of the feature
- Simplifies the migration history

## Testing

After applying the migration fix, we ran the tests to ensure that the feature works correctly, and all tests passed. The latest research categories feature now properly:

1. Displays latest articles grouped by team category
2. Limits to 20 articles per category
3. Shows only articles from the last 30 days
4. Orders articles by discovery date (newest first)
5. Orders categories alphabetically

## Future Considerations

When making model changes in the future:
1. Plan the model design carefully before implementation
2. Try to create a single, clean migration rather than multiple incremental ones
3. Test migrations in a staging environment before production
4. Document the migration process for future reference
