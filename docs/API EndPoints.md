# [GregoryAI](https://gregory-ai.com/) API EndPoints

[TOC]

## Preferred Endpoints vs Legacy

> **üìã MIGRATION COMPLETE:** The API has been successfully migrated from separate endpoints to query parameter filtering for better consistency and flexibility.

**Status**: All deprecated legacy endpoints have been removed. The migration to parameter-based filtering is complete.

**‚úÖ New Parameter-Based Features Available:**
- `relevant=true` - Filter for ML-predicted and manually-reviewed relevant articles
- `open_access=true` - Filter for open access articles  
- `unsent=true` - Filter for articles not yet sent to subscribers
- `last_days=N` - Filter for articles from the last N days (can combine with other filters)
- `week=N&year=YYYY` - Filter for articles from a specific week (can combine with other filters)

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Basic usage with monthly counts (default threshold: 0.5)
GET /categories/?category_id=6&monthly_counts=true

# High confidence ML predictions (0.8)
GET /categories/?category_id=6&monthly_counts=true&ml_threshold=0.8

# Low threshold to include more predictions (0.3)
GET /categories/?category_id=6&monthly_counts=true&ml_threshold=0.3

# Very high confidence predictions only (0.95)
GET /categories/?category_id=6&monthly_counts=true&ml_threshold=0.95

# Get category data without monthly counts
GET /categories/?category_id=6
```

The endpoints use a flexible query parameter system that allows combining multiple filters.

| Filter | Preferred Endpoint | Benefits | 
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Team articles | `GET /articles/?team_id=1` | Unified filtering, parameter combinations |
| Team subjects | `GET /subjects/?team_id=1` | Consistent filtering approach |
| Team + subject | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&subject_id=4` | Mix with other filters |
| Team + category (slug) | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&category_slug=natalizumab` | All filtering options available |
| Team + category (ID) | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&category_id=5` | Flexible ID-based filtering |
| Team + source | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&source_id=123` | Consistent with other endpoints |
| Relevant articles | `GET /articles/?relevant=true` | Boolean filtering for ML predictions and manual selection |
| Recent relevant articles | `GET /articles/?relevant=true&last_days=15` | Time-based filtering with relevance |
| Weekly relevant articles | `GET /articles/?relevant=true&week=52&year=2024` | Specific week filtering with relevance |
| Open access articles | `GET /articles/?open_access=true` | Filter by accessibility |
| Unsent articles | `GET /articles/?unsent=true` | Filter by notification status |
| Complex filtering | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&subject_id=4&author_id=123&search=stem&relevant=true` | Only possible with new approach |

### Legacy Endpoints Migration Complete

All legacy endpoints have been successfully migrated to the new parameter-based filtering system. The following endpoints have been **removed** and replaced:

| Former Legacy Pattern | Status | Current Endpoint |
|----------------------|--------|------------------|
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/subjects/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/subjects/?team_id={id}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/subject/{subject_id}/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}&subject_id={subject_id}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/category/{category_slug}/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}&category_slug={category_slug}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/source/{source_id}/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}&source_id={source_id}` |
| `GET /articles/relevant/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?relevant=true` |
| `GET /articles/relevant/last/{days}/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?relevant=true&last_days={days}` |
| `GET /articles/relevant/week/{year}/{week}/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?relevant=true&week={week}&year={year}` |
| `GET /articles/open-access/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?open_access=true` |
| `GET /articles/unsent/` | ‚úÖ **Migrated** | `/articles/?unsent=true` |

**Migration Benefits:**
- **Unified Filtering**: All filters can be combined in a single endpoint
- **Better Performance**: Optimized query structure for faster responses
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Mix and match any combination of filters
- **Consistent API**: All endpoints follow the same parameter pattern

## Data Formats

All API endpoints support three formats:

1. **JSON** (default): Standard JSON format for API responses
2. **HTML** (browsable API): A user-friendly HTML interface for browsing the API
3. **CSV**: Data in comma-separated values format for spreadsheet applications

To get the response in CSV format, you can either:

1. Add the format parameter: `?format=csv` to the URL
2. Set the Accept header to `text/csv`

Example:
```bash
# Using format parameter
curl https://api.example.com/articles/?format=csv

# Using Accept header
curl -H "Accept: text/csv" https://api.example.com/articles/
```

### CSV Export Features

When exporting data as CSV, the following features are available:

1. **Pagination Bypass**: Add `all_results=true` to retrieve all data without pagination (useful for downloading complete datasets)
2. **Clean Data Format**: The CSV export automatically:
   - Consolidates nested fields (authors, subjects, clinical_trials, etc.) into single, readable columns
   - Properly formats and escapes text fields to handle special characters
   - Sets meaningful column names
   - Uses a standardized filename format (e.g., gregory-ai-articles-2023-07-15.csv)
3. **Type Safety**: All values are properly converted to strings to ensure compatibility with CSV format

Example for exporting all search results as CSV:
```bash
# Export all articles matching a search query as CSV
curl https://api.example.com/articles/search/?team_id=1&subject_id=1&search=covid&format=csv&all_results=true

# Export all clinical trials matching a search query as CSV
curl https://api.example.com/trials/search/?team_id=1&subject_id=1&status=Recruiting&format=csv&all_results=true
```

## Remaining Team-Based Endpoints

Some team-based URL patterns are still available for backward compatibility, though they are marked as deprecated in favor of the new parameter-based filtering approach.

### Still Available (Deprecated)

The following legacy endpoints are still functional but **deprecated**. They continue to work with enhanced filtering capabilities:

```bash
# Still available: Get all articles for a team (enhanced with full filtering)
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/?format=json&page=1
# Enhanced capabilities: &search=keyword&author_id=X&category_slug=Y&journal_slug=Z&ordering=field

# Still available: Get articles for a team filtered by subject (enhanced with full filtering) 
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/subject/{subject_id}/?format=json
# Enhanced capabilities: &search=keyword&author_id=X&category_slug=Y&journal_slug=Z&ordering=field

# Still available: Get subjects for a team (enhanced with full filtering)
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/?format=json
# Enhanced capabilities: &search=keyword&ordering=field

# Still available: Get articles for a team filtered by category
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/category/{category_slug}/

# Still available: Get articles for a team filtered by source
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/source/{source_id}/
```

### Active Team-Based Endpoints

These team-based endpoints remain active and are **not deprecated**:
```bash
# Active: Get categories for a team and subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/{subject_id}/categories/

# Active: Get monthly counts for a category
GET /teams/{team_id}/categories/{category_slug}/monthly_counts/
# Optional ML filtering: ?ml_threshold=0.8
```

**Enhanced filtering capabilities available on deprecated endpoints:**
- `?author_id=X` - Filter by author ID (articles only)
- `?category_slug=slug` - Filter by category (articles only)
- `?journal_slug=slug` - Filter by journal (articles only, URL-encoded)
- `?source_id=Y` - Filter by source ID (articles only)
- `?search=keyword` - Full-text search in title/summary (articles) or name/description (subjects)

### Migration Recommendation

While the deprecated endpoints continue to work, we **strongly recommend** migrating to the new parameter-based endpoints for better performance and flexibility:

# Standard: Get monthly counts for a category
GET /categories/{category_id}/monthly_counts/
# Optional ML filtering: ?ml_threshold=0.8
```

```bash
# Legacy: Get all articles for a team
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/?format=json&page=1

# Legacy: Get articles for a team filtered by subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/subject/{subject_id}/?format=json

# Legacy: Get articles for a team filtered by category
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/category/{category_slug}/

# Legacy: Get articles for a team filtered by source
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/source/{source_id}/

# Legacy: Get subjects for a team
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/

# Legacy: Get categories for a team and subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/{subject_id}/categories/

```bash
# DEPRECATED: Basic legacy usage
GET /teams/1/articles/?format=json&page=1

# ENHANCED: Legacy usage with new filtering (still deprecated)
GET /teams/1/articles/?format=json&page=1&search=multiple+sclerosis&author_id=123&ordering=-published_date

# PREFERRED: Equivalent using main endpoint
GET /articles/?team_id=1&search=multiple+sclerosis&author_id=123&ordering=-published_date

# DEPRECATED: Subject filtering
GET /teams/1/articles/subject/4/?format=json&search=regeneration&category_slug=stem-cells

# PREFERRED: Equivalent using main endpoint
GET /articles/?team_id=1&subject_id=4&search=regeneration&category_slug=stem-cells

# DEPRECATED: Subjects for team
GET /teams/1/subjects/?format=json&search=multiple&ordering=subject_name

# PREFERRED: Equivalent using main endpoint  
GET /subjects/?team_id=1&search=multiple&ordering=subject_name
```

- **Consistent API**: All endpoints follow the same parameter pattern
- **Better Performance**: Optimized for the new filtering architecture
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: All filters can be combined in any way
- **Future-Proof**: Built for scalability and new features

```bash
# Default ML threshold (0.5)
GET /teams/1/categories/natalizumab/monthly-counts/
