# Gregory API EndPoints

## Preferred Endpoints vs Legacy

> **üìã MIGRATION NOTICE:** The API is transitioning from team-based URL patterns to query parameter filtering for better consistency and flexibility.

### Preferred Approach (‚úÖ Recommended# Standard: Get categories for a team and subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/{subject_id}/categories/

# Standard: Get monthly counts for a team category
GET /teams/{team_id}/categories/{category_slug}/monthly-counts/
```

**Status**: All legacy endpoints are fully functional and tested. They continue to work alongside the new filtering system to ensure backward compatibility for existing clients.| Preferred Endpoint | Benefits |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Team articles | `GET /articles/?team_id=1` | Unified filtering, parameter combinations |
| Team subjects | `GET /subjects/?team_id=1` | Consistent filtering approach |
| Team + subject | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&subject_id=4` | Mix with other filters |
| Team + category (slug) | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&category_slug=natalizumab` | All filtering options available |
| Team + category (ID) | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&category_id=5` | Flexible ID-based filtering |
| Team + source | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&source_id=123` | Consistent with other endpoints |
| Complex filtering | `GET /articles/?team_id=1&subject_id=4&author_id=123&search=stem` | Only possible with new approach |

### Legacy Endpoints (‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated)

| Legacy Pattern | Status | Migration Target |
|---------------|--------|------------------|
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/subjects/` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** | `/subjects/?team_id={id}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/subject/{subject_id}/` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}&subject_id={subject_id}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/category/{category_slug}/` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}&category_slug={category_slug}` |
| `GET /teams/{id}/articles/source/{source_id}/` | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** | `/articles/?team_id={id}&source_id={source_id}` |

**Deprecation Headers:** Legacy endpoints include migration guidance in response headers:
- `X-Deprecation-Warning`: Deprecation notice
- `X-Migration-Guide`: Recommended replacement endpoint
- `X-Deprecated-Endpoint`: Current deprecated endpoint path

## Data Formats

All API endpoints support three formats:

1. **JSON** (default): Standard JSON format for API responses
2. **HTML** (browsable API): A user-friendly HTML interface for browsing the API
3. **CSV**: Data in comma-separated values format for spreadsheet applications

To get the response in CSV format, you can either:

1. Add the format parameter: `?format=csv` to the URL
2. Set the Accept header to `text/csv`

Example:
```bash
# Using format parameter
curl https://api.example.com/articles/?format=csv

# Using Accept header
curl -H "Accept: text/csv" https://api.example.com/articles/
```

### CSV Export Features

When exporting data as CSV, the following features are available:

1. **Pagination Bypass**: Add `all_results=true` to retrieve all data without pagination (useful for downloading complete datasets)
2. **Clean Data Format**: The CSV export automatically:
   - Consolidates nested fields (authors, subjects, clinical_trials, etc.) into single, readable columns
   - Properly formats and escapes text fields to handle special characters
   - Sets meaningful column names
   - Uses a standardized filename format (e.g., gregory-ai-articles-2023-07-15.csv)
3. **Type Safety**: All values are properly converted to strings to ensure compatibility with CSV format

Example for exporting all search results as CSV:
```bash
# Export all articles matching a search query as CSV
curl https://api.example.com/articles/search/?team_id=1&subject_id=1&search=covid&format=csv&all_results=true

# Export all clinical trials matching a search query as CSV
curl https://api.example.com/trials/search/?team_id=1&subject_id=1&status=Recruiting&format=csv&all_results=true
```

## Legacy URL Support

The API maintains backward compatibility with legacy URL patterns used by existing clients. These endpoints are still fully functional and **now include enhanced filtering capabilities** while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

### Enhanced Legacy Team-Based Endpoints

The following legacy endpoints have been upgraded to support the full filtering system:

```bash
# Enhanced: Get all articles for a team (now supports full filtering)
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/?format=json&page=1
# New capabilities: &search=keyword&author_id=X&category_slug=Y&journal_slug=Z&ordering=field

# Enhanced: Get articles for a team filtered by subject (now supports full filtering) 
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/subject/{subject_id}/?format=json
# New capabilities: &search=keyword&author_id=X&category_slug=Y&journal_slug=Z&ordering=field

# Enhanced: Get subjects for a team (now supports full filtering)
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/?format=json
# New capabilities: &search=keyword&ordering=field
```

**New filtering capabilities added to legacy endpoints:**
- `?author_id=X` - Filter by author ID (articles only)
- `?category_slug=slug` - Filter by category (articles only)
- `?journal_slug=slug` - Filter by journal (articles only, URL-encoded)
- `?source_id=Y` - Filter by source ID (articles only)
- `?search=keyword` - Full-text search in title/summary (articles) or name/description (subjects)
- `?ordering=field` - Order by discovery_date, published_date, title, article_id (articles) or id, subject_name (subjects) (add `-` for reverse)

### Standard Legacy Team-Based Endpoints

The following legacy patterns maintain their original functionality:

```bash
# Standard: Get articles for a team filtered by category
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/category/{category_slug}/

# Standard: Get articles for a team filtered by source
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/source/{source_id}/

# Standard: Get subjects for a team
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/

# Standard: Get categories for a team and subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/{subject_id}/categories/

# Standard: Get authors for a team and subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/subjects/{subject_id}/authors/

# Standard: Get authors for a team and category
GET /teams/{team_id}/categories/{category_slug}/authors/

# Standard: Get monthly counts for a team category
GET /teams/{team_id}/categories/{category_slug}/monthly-counts/
# Optional ML filtering: ?ml_threshold=0.8
```

```bash
# Legacy: Get all articles for a team
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/?format=json&page=1

# Legacy: Get articles for a team filtered by subject
GET /teams/{team_id}/articles/subject/{subject_id}/?format=json

```

**Status**: All legacy endpoints are fully functional and tested. They continue to work alongside the new filtering system to ensure backward compatibility for existing clients.

### Migration Guide: Legacy vs New Filtering

While legacy URLs continue to work, they now support enhanced filtering capabilities:

```bash
# BEFORE: Basic legacy usage
GET /teams/1/articles/?format=json&page=1

# AFTER: Enhanced legacy usage with new filtering
GET /teams/1/articles/?format=json&page=1&search=multiple+sclerosis&author_id=123&ordering=-published_date

# BEFORE: Basic subject filtering
GET /teams/1/articles/subject/4/?format=json

# AFTER: Enhanced subject filtering with additional filters
GET /teams/1/articles/subject/4/?format=json&search=regeneration&category_slug=stem-cells&journal_slug=Nature

# NEW: Equivalent using main endpoint
GET /articles/?team_id=1&subject_id=4&search=regeneration&category_slug=stem-cells&journal_slug=Nature

# BEFORE: Basic subjects for team
GET /teams/1/subjects/?format=json

# AFTER: Enhanced subjects with filtering
GET /teams/1/subjects/?format=json&search=multiple&ordering=subject_name

# NEW: Equivalent using main endpoint  
GET /subjects/?team_id=1&search=multiple&ordering=subject_name
```

**Benefits of the enhanced legacy endpoints:**
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing URLs continue to work exactly as before
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Now support the same comprehensive filtering as `/articles/`
- **Multiple Filters**: Combine search, author, category, journal, and source filters
- **Flexible Ordering**: Sort by any supported field with ascending/descending options
- **Seamless Migration**: Gradually add new filters without changing base URLs

### Examples of Enhanced Legacy Filtering

```bash
# Search within team articles
GET /teams/1/articles/?search=multiple+sclerosis&format=json

# Filter team articles by author and order by publication date
GET /teams/1/articles/?author_id=415009&ordering=-published_date&format=json

# Search within team + subject articles with journal filter
GET /teams/1/articles/subject/4/?search=regeneration&journal_slug=Nature&format=json

# Complex filtering on team articles
GET /teams/1/articles/?search=stem+cells&category_slug=clinical-trials&author_id=123&ordering=title&format=json

# Search team subjects
GET /teams/1/subjects/?search=multiple&format=json

# Order team subjects by name
GET /teams/1/subjects/?ordering=subject_name&format=json
```
